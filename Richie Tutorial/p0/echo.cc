int main() {
  // we will read data into this space on the stack  It can be any size, but
  // we'll do 16 bytes at a time.
  char buffer[16];

  // NB: While it's tempting to use scanf() or cin to read from stdin, they
  //     will parse the input and only read one thing (text word, integer, etc).
  //     If we want to read all of the user's input exactly, we can't use
  //     something that will treat consecutive whitespace as a word boundary, so
  //     instead we need to use something from the "get" family.  One should
  //     NEVER use 'gets()', because it does not bound how much data is read,
  //     and we always must read into a buffer of bounded size.  Much better is
  //     to use fgets, which takes a pointer to a buffer, the size of the
  //     buffer, and a file stream (in our case stdin).

  // NB: fgets() will read at most sizeof(buffer)-1 bytes, so that it can add a
  //     \0 as the last character (so that printf-style functions will work)
  //
  // NB: We should be paying attention to errors from fgets, but in this program
  //     we don't.  This program represents the last time we are allowed to
  //     ignore errors in this tutorial series.
  while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin)) {
    // NB: This version of printf is effectively 'fputs(buffer, stdout)'

    // NB: We are ignoring the return value from printf().  The tutorial series
    //     will limit uses of printf(), so that we can always ignore printf()
    //     errors.
